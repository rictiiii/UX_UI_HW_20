                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>Beginning with conducting 5 interviews in order to discover what safety concerns our users had
                        and resources they would like to have regarding their safety issues. We discovered that there
                        was a high priority on a resource that can provide in depth details of safe places to explore,
                        local laws, and emergency contact information.
                        <br><br>I surveyed 24 participants, ages 21-45, who on average stated that safety is a high priority
                        while they travel and they would like to know of potential dangers when traveling to their
                        specific destination. Some of my interviewees expressed safety tips they would like to receive
                        and current travel concerns they may have while traveling.

                    <h3>Definition</h3>

                    <p>A user persona was created — Priscilla Perez, who is an adventurous traveler. She needs an online
                        platform that prevents unsafe situations when she travels, because safety is very important to
                        her travel experience, she wants to get notifications and tips in order to avoid unsafe areas
                        and activities.
                        <br><br>
                        Safety Pin should be designed to prevent travelers from encountering unsafe areas and
                        activities, I have observed that travelers don’t usually have enough knowledge about the place
                        they visit, and often walk in unsafe areas without knowing. How might we design Safety Pin so
                        that when people travel in an unfamiliar city, they can gather safety tips and get alerts while
                        they’re wandering around?

                    <h3 class="">Ideation</h3>

                    <p>After understanding the user insight, I started brainstorming, and generated quick ideas that
                        could help the users with their pain points. I prioritized the ideas using a 2x2 matrix. From
                        the matrix, I identified a few ideas my app should focus on:
                        <br><br>
                        <b>1. Safety Pin should provide a platform for people to share their travel experience
                            <br><br>
                            2. Notify users when they’re entering unsafe areas
                            <br><br>
                            3. Allow local residents to provide tips for travelers
                            <br><br>
                            4. Gather safety tips and present to users
                        </b>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>

                    <p>I made competitor analysis on 4 apps: Smart Traveler, TripLingo, Lyft, and bSafe. From which I found inspirations, as well as problems I should avoid.  I satarted drawing sketches, and then creating digital wireframs based on the drafts.

                    <h3 class="">User Testing + Iteration</h3>

                    <p>In this session, I created Guerrilla Testing plan, in order to identify pain points in the process of gathering safety tips on Safety Pin. Based on the testing feedback, I added Setting and Profile pages, more coaching screens about different functions, avoided re-login after registration and resetting password, as well as improving other lower prioritised functions.

                    <h3 class="">Finish Product</h3>

                    <p>In this project, I got to explore the pain points travelers generally have, and through my empathy towards them, I designed Safety Pin. This app helps them navigate through unsafe areas and provides emergency solutions.
<br><br>
                        During the process, I learned that researching and creating surveys for the target customers is important, as I found new/surprising ideas about what specific problems I could focus on. As a UX designer, it is crucial to have empathy for the customer’s pain points, and to create solutions from innovative, unique perspectives.
