                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>A drive-in music festival experience that provides designated entry time, socially distanced area to
                    enjoy the show, food and drinks delivered with drones, and a new way to connect with people.</p>

                <h3>Why</h3>
                <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are bored with staying home all the time. There are few options
                    to have fun and socialize safely.</p>

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>We started our research with our proto persona: Zane Hassel, a 25 year old party animal whose tired
                    of restrictions and needs to find a way to let loose and rock out. From there, we created and sent
                    out a survey and discovered the majority of people missed having fun/ social activities (As we
                    suspected) and that the top no-contact methods for concerts people prefered are staying in vehicles
                    and fenced- areas for social distancing. </p>
                <p>Our team belived creating a drive-in festival could be the solution to these frustrations. We
                    researched potential competitors, and they gave us inspiration as to what to include in our own
                    designs: <b>A desktop design to order tickets and get important faqs and directions and An app to
                        use during the festival to order food and socialize</b>.</p>
                <p>We compiled our research and created the user persona: Zoey Roberts, a 29 yr old influencer whose
                    passionate about festivals and frustrated with the current no-contact music event options. She’s on
                    the search for an event thats fun and safe and lets her hear that bass drop.</p>

                    <h3 >Definition</h3>
                <p>Zoey is searching for a safe and exciting no-contact music festival that is just as engaging as
                    pre-pandemic events where she can have fun and socialize safely. One where COVID safety measures are
                    implemented in a way that will keep her safe but won't prevent her from having a good time.</p>

                <p>People like Zoey are generally tired of COVID restrictions and have exhausted all of their at-home
                    entertainment options. While they are still very concerned about their health and safety during the
                    pandemic, they are searching for a safe, engaging, smoothly run event where COVID safety measures
                    are implemented in a way that will keep them safe but won't prevent them from having a good time.
                </p>

                <p>How might we create a website/app that provides information about a no-contact music festival while
                    reassuring attendees that the event will be safe, efficient and entertaining so that those seeking
                    excitement during the pandemic will be motivated enough to attend a no-contact festival?</p>

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>We brainstormed and decided on 3 key features to include in our design:</p>
                <b>
                    <p> • Ordering food from our app and have it delivered by drone </p>
                    <p> • 360 degree stage</p>
                    <p>• Designating numbers for each parking area so attendees can communicate with each other and send
                        food/drinks</p>
                </b>
                <p>2 user flows for the app:</p>
                <p> <b>Drone Food Delivery</b> -— We believe using drones to deliver food and drinks can avoid contacts
                    and large gatherings, therefore ensure the users’ safety </p>
                <p> <b>Concert Chat</b> -— Even though users are required to stay in their designated area, they can
                    still use this function to socialize with new people in the festival! They can simply find the
                    person they’re interested in through the map, and decide to send them a message or a drink </p>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Here’s the lo-fi version of the concert chat user flow. Zoey sees a boy she would like to talk to.
                    She clicks on his parking space number, then clicks on his profile. She initiates a chat and sends
                    him a drink</p>
                <p>Later, Zoey decides to order food for herself. She clicks on the food icon in the bottom bar, browses
                    the food menu, makes her selection and pays with her saved credit card that she setup when buying
                    tickets. Her food is then delivered to her parking space via drone</p>

                    <h3>User Testing + Iteration</h3>
                <p>Some iterations we made based on feedback from user testing:</p>

                <b>
                    <p> • We re-designed the ordering process in the food flow to have the user select the food items
                        first, then confirm item quantity on a pushup screen</p>

                    <p>• We also added the recipient’s UserName to the bottom of the Order Received message to make it
                        clear who the order was being sent to</p>

                    <p>• We added status icons to profiles so users could indicate if they were available to chat with
                        other attendees and went through a few versions of the user profile screen - ending up with the
                        version on the bottom left with the “Send Food/Drink” button option</p>

                        <p> • Adding a Live News feed for users to post during the festival to motivate socializing/
                            initiating chatting</p>

                        <p> • Reach out to competitor events to discuss designing a festival app for them</p>
