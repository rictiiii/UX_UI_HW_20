                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>UI & UX redesign project for Griffith Observatory’s official website, the goal of the project was to
                    create an easy and enjoyble experience for users to find basic visitor information, obtain details
                    for events, and purchase tickets online.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div></div>
            <div>
                <h3>Why</h3>
                <p>The current website is poorly constructed with confusing information architecture, lack of hierarchy,
                    and unappealing content display. Based on our research, users are unable to locate basic visitor
                    information desired.

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>To kick off the project, we first created a proto persona as our expected user—Charlotte Walker, who
                        desires adventure that provides stress relief and inspiration. Some frustrations Charlotte
                        encounters when trying to discover new activities include not being able to find important
                        information such as cost and other general information about the location. In order to solidify this
                        persona and really under stand our targeting users, we gathered a series of interview questions, and
                        created an online survey to obtain more information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the mean time, we wanted to understand the website's current structure and what we could possibly
                        improve, so we went through the following process:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Heuristic Evaluation</b><br>The current website's information architecture is not well
                        organized, the placement of many contents seem to be random. The navigation system needs to be
                        rearranged in a more clear structure, and avoid having redondant information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Competitor Analysis</b><br>Comparing to other landmark and space-related websites (National
                        Air and Space museum, Space X, Chinese Theather...), Griffith Observatory's website is lacking an
                        easy-to-user user experience, and the sentimental feel of space or romance that this landmark has.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <br><b>Contact Stake Holder </b><br>From the stake holder's responds, we learned that "The main goal
                        is to enable people to plan their visit effectively and to make their visit as enriching and
                        engaging as possible. Our other goal is to share relevant content".

                    <p>
                        We ended up receiving 6 interview feedback and 24 survey results. After organizing the data, we
                        formulated a redefined proto persona-Josh Smith, who has needs and pain points relating to his
                        experiences exploring a landmark’s home page. A story board was created used the Josh Smith persona
                        detailing his stresses and frustrations for not being able to find general information on the
                        Griffith Observatory website. Josh Smith needs Griffith Observatory's websites to <b>provide clear
                            general customer information (parking, pricing, location, and history) and event details, as
                            well as an easy-to-use user experience</b>. Because the current website is overwhelming with
                        different information and links arranged without order; it's difficult to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Griffith Observatory's website is designed to provide visitors with information, such as directions,
                        hours, and ongoing events. Users were unable to locate this information due to unclear navigation,
                        lack of hierarchy, and a confusing display of content. <b>How might we redesign the Griffith
                            Observatory website so users are able to locate and access important information about the
                            landmark in a quick and feasible manner?</b>

                    Our team bainstormed together, using “I Like, I Wish, What if” method, and organize our thoughts and
                    users' thoughts based off the data we have collected thus far. We organized all ideas onto a feathre
                    prioritization matrix, from which, we concluded our fucuses for this redesign:

                    <b> Appealing visuals</b><br>
                    With the understanding of Griffith Observatory's main attractions, we created a style tile,
                    incorporated with rich colors that reflect the sentiments of sunset, space, romance, and instagram.

                    <b>Easy-to-follow navigation</b><br>
                    We went through Card Sorting, rearranged the categories and created a new sitemap.

                    In the User Flow, our persona Josh Smith has the option to find events from a calendar, and purchase
                    tickets from there.

                    <p>
                        Using our User Flow as a guide, a Lo-Fi Mobile Prototype was designed with the intention of
                        usability testing and how users would interact with the product.

                    <p>
                        User tests were conducted to research and verify the usability of our Lo-Fi mobile prototype.
                        Following these tests, the team took in the data to reiterate the prototype to create a mid-fi
                        prototype. Some of the iterations include:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
