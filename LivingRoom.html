                <h3>What</h3>
                <p>An app inforporates AR technology, for users to visualize their room's design before committing to
                    buying furniture.</p>

                <h3>Why</h3>
                <p>People find it difficult to visualize how furniture would fit their space when shopping for home
                    furnishings.</p>

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>In this case study, we developed our user research plan after first creating a proto persona. After
                    gathering data from 16 survey responses, we conducted 6 one-on-one interviews with users who
                    provided information into their thought process when purchasing furniture, with a goal to gain
                    insight on how to make furniture shopping a better experience. From there, we then defined our user
                    persona.</p>

                    <h3 >Definition</h3>
                <p>Anthony needs to visualize furniture based on his desired aesthetic, size, quality & price while
                    shopping for furniture because of his need to see the furniture before committing to spend a lot of
                    money on it so that he does not regret purchasing it later.</p>

                <p>Users have a hard time visualizing if the furniture to fit in their space while matching their room
                    aesthetic and buying reasonably priced quality furniture. We might do this by using the AR
                    technology. Doing this will allow our user to make the visualization process more realistic from the
                    comfort and convenience of their home.</p>

                <p>LivingRoom is designed to allow users to find the most fitting furniture based on the user's desired
                    aesthetic, quality, size, and price. We have observed that it's difficult for furniture buyers to
                    visualize what fits their space, and often buy something they'll regret later on. How might we
                    design LivingRoom so that when people shop for furniture online, they can get recommendations for
                    furniture according to the style of their space, visualize the furniture in there, and compare
                    different models in order to get the best price and quality?</p>

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>It was our conclusion that it would be most impactful if users could create their own room design and
                    inspiration boards and virtually measure their room dimensions to see their furniture in place
                    before going to the store.</p>

                <p>We conducted a competitor analysis by downloading and exploring 4 different apps. Homestyler and
                    ProShopper were 2 direct competitors. Homestyler features augmented reality and social media feeds,
                    while Pro Shopper simply worked as an app that took you to a website for purchasing furniture. Both
                    of these apps provided ideas we could learn from. </p>

                <p>With clear ideas of what we should focus on, our user flow was created, begining with onboarding,
                    users would go through AR room scanning and get furniture recommendations, furniture slection and
                    placement, and then check out. </p>

                <p>With clear ideas of what we should focus on, our user flow was created, begining with onboarding,
                    users would go through AR room scanning and get furniture recommendations, furniture slection and
                    placement, and then check out. A rough draft of wireframes was created to visualize each step of
                    this process. </p>

                    <h3>User Testing + Iteration</h3>
                <p>Our team’s goal was to determine whether LivingRoom functions as intended. Are users able to
                    successfully flow through the app’s feature’s with ease? What are some pain points and frustrations
                    that the user encountered? And how can we improve upon the things they don’t like in the app? We
                    created 3 tasks for our testers.</p>

                <p>All of our users were able to successfully work through each task. However, they had some suggestions
                    that we could improve upon. For instance, one users suggested back buttons for the user survey
                    portion. Another user recommended clarity in how one might enter room dimensions manually. Upon
                    checkout, one user would have liked to see a review order tab on the final checkout page.</p>

                <p>Overall, users liked how much guidance they were given. They also liked seeing progress bars when
                    there were several tasks asked of them.

                <p>We then iterated some parts of our user flow, and created our final design. From this project, our
                    key takeaway was that communication, teamwork and iterating was crucial in brainstorming and
                    creating a successful product. </p>
