              <h3>What</h3>
              <p>An app inforporates AR technology, for users to visualize their room's design before committing to buying furniture.</p>
          </div>
          <div></div>
          <div>
              <h3>Why</h3>
              <p>People find it difficult to visualize how furniture would fit their space when shopping for home furnishings.</p>

              <h3 class="research">User Research</h3>
              <p>In this case study, we developed our user research plan after first creating a proto persona. After gathering data from 16 survey responses, we conducted 6 one-on-one interviews with users who provided information into their thought process when purchasing furniture, with a goal to gain insight on how to make furniture shopping a better experience. From there, we then defined our user persona.</p>
              <h3 class="definition">Definition</h3>
              <p>Anthony needs to visualize furniture based on his desired aesthetic, size, quality & price while shopping for furniture because of his need to see the furniture before committing to spend a lot of money on it so that he does not regret purchasing it later.</p>

                <p>Users have a hard time visualizing if the furniture to fit in their space while matching their room aesthetic and buying reasonably priced quality furniture. We might do this by using the AR technology. Doing this will allow our user to make the visualization process more realistic from the comfort and convenience of their home.</p>
                
                <p>LivingRoom is designed to allow users to find the most fitting furniture based on the user's desired aesthetic, quality, size, and price. We have observed that it's difficult for furniture buyers to visualize what fits their space, and often buy something they'll regret later on. How might we design LivingRoom so that when people shop for furniture online, they can get recommendations for furniture according to the style of their space, visualize the furniture in there, and compare different models in order to get the best price and quality?</p>
              <h3 class="ideation">Ideation</h3>
              <p>It was our conclusion that it would be most impactful if users could create their own room design and inspiration boards and virtually measure their room dimensions to see their furniture in place before going to the store.</p>

                <p>We conducted a competitor analysis by downloading and exploring 4 different apps. Homestyler and ProShopper were 2 direct competitors. Homestyler features augmented reality and social media feeds, while Pro Shopper simply worked as an app that took you to a website for purchasing furniture. Both of these apps provided ideas we could learn from. </p>
                
                <p>With clear ideas of what we should focus on, our user flow was created, begining with onboarding, users would go through AR room scanning and get furniture recommendations, furniture slection and placement, and then check out. </p>
              <h3 class="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>
              <p>With clear ideas of what we should focus on, our user flow was created, begining with onboarding, users would go through AR room scanning and get furniture recommendations, furniture slection and placement, and then check out. A rough draft of wireframes was created to visualize each step of this process. </p>
              <h3 class="testing">User Testing + Iteration</h3>
              <p>Our team’s goal was to determine whether LivingRoom functions as intended. Are users able to successfully flow through the app’s feature’s with ease? What are some pain points and frustrations that the user encountered? And how can we improve upon the things they don’t like in the app? We created 3 tasks for our testers.</p>

              <p>All of our users were able to successfully work through each task. However, they had some suggestions that we could improve upon. For instance, one users suggested back buttons for the user survey portion. Another user recommended clarity in how one might enter room dimensions manually. Upon checkout, one user would have liked to see a review order tab on the final checkout page.</p>
                
              <p>Overall, users liked how much guidance they were given. They also liked seeing progress bars when there were several tasks asked of them.</p>
                
                </p>
              <h3 class="finish">Finish Product</h3>
              <p>We then iterated some parts of our user flow, and created our final design. From this project, our key takeaway was that communication, teamwork and iterating was crucial in brainstorming and creating a successful product. </p>
